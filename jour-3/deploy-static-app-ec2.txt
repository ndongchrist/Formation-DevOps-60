Deploying a Static Website on AWS EC2 Using Nginx

Prerequisites
    An AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu (or any Linux distribution).

    A .pem file for SSH access to the EC2 instance.

    Your static website files (zipped or unzipped).

Step 1: Connect to Your EC2 Instance
    Open your terminal.

    Navigate to the directory where your .pem file is located.

    Use the following command to connect to your EC2 instance:

    # command    
        ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
        Replace your-key.pem with the name of your .pem file and your-ec2-public-ip with the public IP address of your EC2 instance.

Step 2: Update and Install Nginx

    Update the package list:
    # command    
        sudo amazon-install-extras nginx

        Start and enable Nginx:
    # command    
        sudo systemctl start nginx
        sudo systemctl enable nginx

    Verify Nginx is running:
    # command    
        sudo systemctl status nginx
        
Step 3: Upload Your Website Files Using SCP
    Open a new terminal window on your local machine.

    Navigate to the directory containing your website files.

    Use the scp command to upload your files to the EC2 instance:
    # command    
        scp -i your-key.pem -r your-website-folder ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip:/home/ubuntu/
        Replace your-website-folder with the name of your folder or zip file.

Step 4: Unzip Your Files (If Necessary)
    SSH into your EC2 instance (if not already connected):
    # command    
        ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip

        Navigate to the directory where you uploaded your files:
    # command    
        cd /home/ubuntu/

        If your files are zipped, unzip them:
    # command    
        unzip your-website-folder.zip
        Replace your-website-folder.zip with the name of your zip file.

Step 5: Configure Nginx to Serve Your Website
    Move your website files to the Nginx web root directory:
    # command    
        sudo mv your-website-folder /usr/share/nginx/html/ 
        sudo nginx -t   
        sudo systemctl restart nginx


Step 6: Access Your Website
    Open a web browser and navigate to your EC2 instance's public IP address:
    http://your-ec2-public-ip
    Your static website should now be live now!
